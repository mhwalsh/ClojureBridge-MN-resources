###Code of Conduct
+ http://bridgefoundry.org/code-of-conduct/

+ http://bridgefoundry.org/code-of-conduct/gray-area.html

####Why this matters?

####Real Examples/Point to Highlight
+ Please do not hand your CV to attendees
+ Clear Examples - Grabbing keyboards - you know you will want to, don't do it. Ask first. Times it is ok: the student's environment is completely borked or something is going wrong with their install fest or helping them by directly typing on their keyboard is outside of the scope of the goals of the workshop.
+ Clear Examples - ```Do not ask anyone out on a date.```
+ Gray area - ```If you are not sure if something is appropriate behavior, it probably isn’t.```
+ Gray area - ```If you didn’t realize that your behavior would have a negative impact, that is your responsibility. Problems happen when we presume that our way of being is ok with everyone, when we assume that our way of thinking or behaving is the norm. This is particularly problematic when the other person is less empowered or is a member of a minority group.```


####Questions?
+ Q: What if a student wants to get in touch with a TA after the event to get help? 

``` 
A: Please, do not hand out your personal contact information. You can give out the info@clojurebridgemn.org. 
All students can be added to our bridges email list: blah.  
This will be a safe place for them to email and ask technical questions. The code of conduct applies for this list as well.
